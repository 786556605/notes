### **Chapter 10. Signals**

### Introduction

Signals are software interrupts. They provide a way of handling asynchronous events. Most nontrivial application programs need to deal with signals.

#### POSIX reliable signals

Signals have been provided since the early versions of the UNIX System, but the signal model provided with systems such as Version 7 was not reliable. Signals could get lost, and it was difficult for a process to turn off selected signals when executing critical regions of code. Both 4.3BSD and SVR3 made changes to the signal model, adding what are called **reliable signals**. But the changes made by Berkeley and AT&T were incompatible. Fortunately, POSIX.1 standardized the reliable-signal routines, and that is what we describe here.

This chapter starts with an overview of signals and a description of what each signal is normally used for, then discusses problems with earlier implementations, since it is often important to understand what is wrong with an implementation before seeing how to do things correctly. This chapter contains numerous examples that are not entirely correct and a discussion of the defects.

### Signal Concepts

* Every signal has a name. They all begin with the three characters `SIG`. For example:
    * `SIGABRT` is the abort signal that is generated when a process calls the `abort` function.
    * `SIGALRM` is the alarm signal that is generated when the timer set by the `alarm` function goes off.

    FreeBSD 8.0 supports 32 different signals. Mac OS X 10.6.8 and Linux 3.2.0 each support 31 different signals, whereas Solaris 10 supports 40 different signals. FreeBSD, Linux, and Solaris, support additional application-defined signals introduced to support **real-time applications**.

* Signal names are all defined by positive integer constants (the signal number) in the header `<signal.h>`.
    * Implementations actually define the individual signals in a different header file, but this header file is included by `<signal.h>`.
    * It bad for the kernel to include header files meant for user-level applications, so if the applications and the kernel both need the same definitions, the information is placed in a kernel header file that is then included by the user-level header file.
        * `<sys/signal.h>`: FreeBSD 8.0 and Mac OS X 10.6.8
        * `<bits/signum.h>`: Linux 3.2.0
        * `<sys/iso/signal_iso.h>`: Solaris 10
* No signal has a signal number of 0. The `kill` function uses the signal number of 0 for a special case. POSIX.1 calls this value the null signal.
* Numerous conditions can generate a signal:
    * The terminal-generated signals occur when users press certain terminal keys. Pressing the DELETE key or Control-C on the terminal normally causes the interrupt signal (`SIGINT`) to be generated.
    * Hardware exceptions generate signals. For example, divide by 0 and invalid memory reference. These conditions are usually detected by the hardware, and the kernel is notified. The kernel then generates the appropriate signal for the process that was running at the time the condition occurred. For example, `SIGSEGV` is generated for a process that executes an invalid memory reference.
    * The `kill(2)` function allows a process to send any signal to another process or process group, with limitations: we have to be the owner of the process that we’re sending the signal to, or we have to be the superuser.
    * The `kill(1)` command allows us to send signals to other processes. This program is just an interface to the `kill` function. This command is often used to terminate a runaway background process.
    * Software conditions can generate signals when a process should be notified of various events. For example:
        * `SIGURG`: generated when out-of-band data arrives over a network connection),
        * `SIGPIPE`: generated when a process writes to a pipe that has no reader)
        * `SIGALRM`: generated when an alarm clock set by the process expires).

Signals are classic examples of asynchronous events. They occur at random times to the process. The process can’t simply test a variable (such as `errno`) to see whether a signal has occurred; instead, the process has to tell the kernel "if and when this signal occurs, do the following".

#### Signal dispositions

We can tell the kernel to do one of three things when a signal occurs. This is called the **disposition of the signal**, or the **action associated with a signal**. ([`signal(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html))

1. **Ignore the signal**. Most signals can be ignored, but two signals can never be ignored: `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP`.
    * The reason these two signals can’t be ignored is to provide the kernel and the superuser with a surefire way of either killing or stopping any process.
    * If we ignore some of the signals that are generated by a hardware exception (such as illegal memory reference or divide by 0), the behavior of the process is undefined.
2. **Catch the signal**. To do this, we tell the kernel to call a function of ours whenever the signal occurs. In our function, we can do whatever we want to handle the condition. For example:
    * If we’re writing a command interpreter, when the user generates the interrupt signal at the keyboard, we probably want to return to the main loop of the program, terminating whatever command we were executing for the user.
    * If the `SIGCHLD` signal is caught, it means that a child process has terminated, so the signal-catching function can call `waitpid` to fetch the child’s process ID and termination status.
    * If the process has created temporary files, we may want to write a signal-catching function for the SIGTERM signal (the termination signal that is the default signal sent by the kill command) to clean up the temporary files.
    * Note that the two signals `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` can’t be caught.
3. **Let the default action apply**. Every signal has a default action. The default action for most signals is to terminate the process.

The signals `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored. ([`signal(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html))

#### UNIX System signals

The following table lists the names of all the signals, an indication of which systems support the signal, and the default action for the signal. The SUS column contains "x" if the signal is defined as part of the base POSIX.1 specification and XSI if it is defined as part of the XSI option. The supported systems are FreeBSD 8.0, Linux 3.2.0, Mac OS X 10.6.8 and Solaris 10.

#### The core file

When the default action (in the table above) is labeled "terminate+core", it means that a memory image of the process is left in the file named `core` of the current working directory of the process. This file can be used with most UNIX System debuggers to examine the state of the process at the time it terminated.

The name of the `core` file varies among implementations.  On Mac OS X 10.6.8, the core file is named core.*pid*, where *pid* is the ID of the process that received the signal. On Linux 3.2.0, the name is configured through `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`. ([`core(5)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html)) [p315]

Most implementations leave the core file in the current working directory of the corresponding process; Mac OS X places all core files in `/cores` instead.

The core file will not be generated if:

* the process was set-user-ID and the current user is not the owner of the program file,
* the process was set-group-ID and the current user is not the group owner of the file,
* the user does not have permission to write in the current working directory,
* the file already exists and the user does not have permission to write to it,
* the file is too big (see `RLIMIT_CORE` limit in [Section 7.11](ch7.md#getrlimit-and-setrlimit-functions))

The permissions of the core file (assuming that the file doesn’t already exist) are usually user-read and user-write, although Mac OS X sets only user-read.

In the table, the signals with a description of "hardware fault" correspond to implementation-defined hardware faults.

#### Detailed description of signals

* `SIGABRT`: generated by calling the `abort` function.  The process terminates abnormally.
* `SIGALRM`:
    * This signal is generated when a timer set with the `alarm` function expires.
    * This signal is also generated when an interval timer set by the `setitimer(2)` function expires.
* `SIGBUS`: indicates an implementation-defined hardware fault.  Implementations usually generate this signal on certain types of memory faults.
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGCANCEL`: used internally by the Solaris threads library. It is not meant for general use.</span>
* `SIGCHLD`: Whenever a process terminates or stops, the `SIGCHLD` signal is sent to the parent. By default, this signal is ignored, so the parent must catch this signal if it wants to be notified whenever a child’s status changes. The normal action in the signal-catching function is to call one of the `wait` functions to fetch the child’s process ID and termination status. [p317]
* `SIGCONT`: this job-control signal is sent to a stopped process when it is continued. The default action is to continue a stopped process, but to ignore the signal if the process wasn’t stopped.
* `SIGEMT`: indicates an implementation-defined hardware fault. Not all platforms support this signal. [p318]
* `SIGFPE`: signals an arithmetic exception, such as divide by 0, floating-point overflow, and so on. The name is derived from "floating-point exception" ([Program Error Signals](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Program-Error-Signals.html)).
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGFREEZE`: defined only by Solaris. </span> [p318]
* `SIGHUP`: this signal is sent to the controlling process (session leader) associated with a controlling terminal if a disconnect is detected by the terminal interface.
    * This signal is generated for this condition only if the terminal’s `CLOCAL` flag is not set. The `CLOCAL` flag for a terminal is set if the attached terminal is local. The flag tells the terminal driver to ignore all modem status lines.
    * The session leader that receives this signal may be in the background ([Figure 9.7](figure_9.7.png)). This differs from the normal terminal-generated signals (interrupt, quit, and suspend), which are always delivered to the foreground process group.
    * This signal is also generated if the session leader terminates. In this case, the signal is sent to each process in the foreground process group.
    * This signal is commonly used to notify daemon processes ([Chapter 13](ch13.md)) to reread their configuration files. The reason `SIGHUP` is chosen for this task is that a daemon should not have a controlling terminal and would normally never receive this signal.
* `SIGILL`: indicates that the process has executed an illegal hardware instruction.
    * 4.3BSD generated this signal from the abort function. `SIGABRT` is now used for this purpose.
* `SIGINFO`: This BSD signal is generated by the terminal driver when we type the status key (often Control-T). This signal is sent to all processes in the foreground process group (Figure 9.9). This signal normally causes status information on processes in the foreground process group to be displayed on the terminal. Linux doesn’t provide support for `SIGINFO`.
* `SIGINT`: generated by the terminal driver when we press the interrupt key (often DELETE or Control-C). This signal is sent to all processes in the foreground process group ([Figure 9.9](figure_9.9.png)). This signal is often used to terminate a runaway program, especially when it’s generating a lot of unwanted output on the screen.
* `SIGIO`: indicates an asynchronous I/O event.
* `SIGIOT`: indicates an implementation-defined hardware fault. `SIGABRT` is now used for this purpose. On FreeBSD 8.0, Linux 3.2.0, Mac OS X 10.6.8, and Solaris 10, `SIGIOT` is defined to be the same value as `SIGABRT`.
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGJVM1` and `SIGJVM2`: reserved for use by the Java virtual machine on Solaris.</span>
* `SIGKILL`: one of the two that can’t be caught or ignored. It provides the system administrator with a sure way to kill any process.
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGLOST`: used to notify a process running on a Solaris NFSv4 client system that a lock could not be reacquired during recovery.</span>
* `SIGPIPE`: If we write to a pipeline but the reader has terminated, `SIGPIPE` is generated. This signal is also generated when a process writes to a socket of type `SOCK_STREAM` that is no longer connected.
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGPOLL`: This signal is marked obsolescent in SUSv4, so it might be removed in a future version of the standard. It can be generated when a specific event occurs on a pollable device.</span>
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGPROF`: This signal is marked obsolescent in SUSv4, so it might be removed in a future version of the standard. This signal is generated when a profiling interval timer set by the `setitimer(2)` function expires.</span>
* `SIGPWR`: system dependent, mainly used on a system that has an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
    * If power fails, the UPS takes over and the software can usually be notified. Nothing needs to be done at this point, as the system continues running on battery power. But if the battery gets low, the software is usually notified again; at this point, it behooves the system to shut everything down. The process that is notified of the low-battery condition sends the `SIGPWR` signal to the `init` process, and `init` handles the system shutdown.
    * Solaris 10 and some Linux distributions have entries in the `inittab` file for this purpose: `powerfail` and `powerwait` (or `powerokwait`).
    * The default action for `SIGPWR` as either "terminate" or "ignore", which depends on the system. The default on Linux is to terminate the process. On Solaris, the signal is ignored by default.
* `SIGQUIT`: generated by the terminal driver when we press the terminal quit key (often Control-backslash). This signal is sent to all processes in the foreground process group ([Figure 9.9](figure_9.9.png)). This signal not only terminates the foreground process group (as does `SIGINT`), but also generates a `core` file.
* `SIGSEGV`: indicates that the process has made an invalid memory reference (which is usually a sign that the program has a bug, such as dereferencing an uninitialized pointer). The name SEGV stands for "segmentation violation".
* `SIGSTKFLT`: This signal is defined only by Linux. It showed up in the earliest versions of Linux, where it was intended to be used for stack faults taken by the math coprocessor. This signal is not generated by the kernel, but remains for backward compatibility.
* `SIGSTOP`: This job-control signal stops a process. It is similar to the interactive stop signal (`SIGTSTP`), but `SIGSTOP` cannot be caught or ignored.
* `SIGSYS`: indicates an invalid system call. The process executed a machine instruction that the kernel thought was a system call, but the parameter with the instruction that indicates the type of system call was invalid. For example, if you build a program that uses a new system call and you then try to run the same binary on an older version of the operating system where the system call doesn’t exist. [p320]
* `SIGTERM`: the termination signal sent by the `kill(1)` command by default. Because it can be caught by applications, using `SIGTERM` gives programs a chance to terminate gracefully by cleaning up before exiting (in contrast to `SIGKILL`, which can’t be caught or ignored).
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGTHAW`: defined only by Solaris and used to notify processes that need to take special action when the system resumes operation after being suspended.</span>
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGTHR`: reserved for use by the thread library on FreeBSD. It is defined to have the same value as `SIGLWP`.</span>
* `SIGTRAP`: indicates an implementation-defined hardware fault. The signal name comes from the PDP-11 TRAP instruction. Implementations often use this signal to transfer control to a debugger when a breakpoint instruction is executed.
* `SIGTSTP`: This interactive stop signal is generated by the terminal driver when we press the terminal suspend key (often Control-Z). This signal is sent to all processes in the foreground process group ([Figure 9.9](figure_9.9.png)). [p321]
* `SIGTTIN`: generated by the terminal driver when a process in a background process group tries to read from its controlling terminal. If either of the following case occurs, the signal is not generated; instead, the read operation fails with errno set to `EIO`:
    * The reading process is ignoring or blocking this signal.
    * The process group of the reading process is orphaned.
* `SIGTTOU`: generated by the terminal driver when a process in a background process group tries to write to its controlling terminal. Unlike the case with background reads, a process can choose to allow background writes to the controlling terminal. If background writes are not allowed, then like the `SIGTTIN` signal, the signal is not generated if either of the following cases occurs; instead, the read operation fails with errno set to `EIO`:
    * The writing process is ignoring or blocking this signal
    * The process group of the writing process is orphaned

    Regardless of whether background writes are allowed, certain terminal operations (other than writing), including `tcsetattr`, `tcsendbreak`, `tcdrain`, `tcflush`, `tcflow`, and `tcsetpgrp` can also generate the `SIGTTOU` signal.

* `SIGURG`: notifies the process that an urgent condition has occurred. It is optionally generated when [out-of-band data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_data) is received on a network connection.
* `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`: user-defined signals, for use in application programs.
* `SIGVTALRM`: generated when a virtual interval timer set by the `setitimer(2)` function expires.
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGWAITING`: used internally by the Solaris threads library, and is not available for general use.</span>
* `SIGWINCH`: The kernel maintains the size of the window associated with each terminal and pseudo terminal. A process can get and set the window size with the `ioctl` function. If a process changes the window size from its previous value using the `ioctl` set-window-size command, the kernel generates the `SIGWINCH` signal for the foreground process group.
* `SIGXCPU`: generated if the process exceeds its soft CPU time limit. The default action depends on the operating system. The Single UNIX Specification requires that the default action be to terminate the process abnormally.
    * Linux 3.2.0 and Solaris 10 support a default action of terminate with a core file
    * FreeBSD 8.0 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 support a default action of terminate without generating a core file.
* `SIGXFSZ`:  generated if the process exceeds its soft file size limit. The default action depends on the operating system, similar to `SIGXCPU`.
* <span class="text-muted">`SIGXRES`: defined only by Solaris.</span>

### `signal` Function

The simplest interface to the signal features of the UNIX System is the signal function

<small>[apue_signal.h](https://gist.github.com/shichao-an/73f4115f93c26a852349)</small>

```c
#include <signal.h>

void (*signal(int signo, void (*func)(int)))(int);

/* Returns: previous disposition of signal (see following) if OK, SIG_ERR on error */
```

Implementations derived from UNIX System V support the `signal` function, which provides the old unreliable-signal semantics. New applications should not use these unreliable signals. 4.4BSD also provides the `signal` function, but it is defined in terms of the `sigaction` function, so using it under 4.4BSD provides the newer reliable-signal semantics. Most current systems follow this strategy except Solaris. [p323]

Because the semantics of signal differ among implementations, we must use the `sigaction` function instead. We provide an implementation of `signal` that uses `sigaction` (later this chapter).

Arguments:

* The *signo* argument is the name of the signal from [previous table](#unix-system-signals).
* The value of *func* one of the following:
    * the constant `SIG_IGN`, which tells the system ignore the signal;
    * the constant `SIG_DFL`, which sets the action associated with the signal to its default value;
    * the address of a function to be called when the signal occurs, which arranges to "catch" the signal. This function is called either the **signal handler** or the **signal-catching function**.

The prototype for the `signal` function states that the function requires two arguments and returns a pointer to a function that returns nothing (`void`):

* The first argument, *signo*, is an integer.
* The second argument, *func*, is a pointer to a function that takes a single integer argument and returns nothing.
* The returned function (function whose address is returned as the value of `signal`) takes a single integer argument (the final (`int`)).

In plain English, this declaration says that the signal handler is passed a single integer argument (the signal number) and that it returns nothing. When we call signal to establish the signal handler, the second argument is a pointer to the function.  The return value from `signal` is the pointer to the previous signal handler.

The `signal` function prototype can be made much simpler through the use of the following `typedef`:

```c
typedef void Sigfunc(int);
```

Then the prototype becomes:

```c
Sigfunc *signal(int, Sigfunc *);
```

This `typedef` is included in [apue.h](https://github.com/shichao-an/apue.3e/blob/master/include/apue.h#L41) and is used with the functions in this chapter.

If we examine the system’s header `<signal.h>`, we will probably find declarations of the form:

```c
#define SIG_ERR (void (*)())-1
#define SIG_DFL (void (*)())0
#define SIG_IGN (void (*)())1
```

These constants can be used in place of the "pointer to a function that takes an integer argument and returns nothing", the second argument to `signal`, and the return value from `signal`. The three values used for these constants need not be −1, 0, and 1. They must be three values that can never be the address of any declarable function. Most UNIX systems use the values shown. (See [Doubts and Solutions](##doubts-and-solutions) for details)

Example:

The following code shows a simple signal handler that catches either of the two user-defined signals and prints the signal number.


* [sigusr.c](https://github.com/shichao-an/apue.3e/blob/master/signals/sigusr.c)

```c
#include "apue.h"

static void	sig_usr(int);	/* one handler for both signals */

int
main(void)
{
	if (signal(SIGUSR1, sig_usr) == SIG_ERR)
		err_sys("can't catch SIGUSR1");
	if (signal(SIGUSR2, sig_usr) == SIG_ERR)
		err_sys("can't catch SIGUSR2");
	for ( ; ; )
		pause();
}

static void
sig_usr(int signo)		/* argument is signal number */
{
	if (signo == SIGUSR1)
		printf("received SIGUSR1\n");
	else if (signo == SIGUSR2)
		printf("received SIGUSR2\n");
	else
		err_dump("received signal %d\n", signo);
}
```

We invoke the program in the background and use the `kill(1)` command to send it signals. The term *kill* in the UNIX System is a misnomer. The `kill(1)` command and the `kill(2)` function just send a signal to a process or process group. Whether that signal terminates the process depends on which signal is sent and whether the process has arranged to catch the signal.

Result:

```shell-session
$ ./a.out &                # start process in background
[1] 7216                   # job-control shell prints job number and process ID
$ kill -USR1 7216          # send it SIGUSR1
received SIGUSR1
$ kill -USR2 7216          # send it SIGUSR2
received SIGUSR2
$ kill 7216                # now send it SIGTERM
[1]+ Terminated ./a.out
```

When we send the `SIGTERM` signal, the process is terminated, since it doesn’t catch the signal, and the default action for the signal is termination.

#### Program Start-Up

When a program is executed, the status of all signals is either default or ignore. All signals are set to their default action, unless the process that calls `exec` is ignoring the signal. The `exec` functions change the disposition of any signals being caught to their default action and leave the status of all other signals alone. The reason is that a signal that is being caught by a process that calls `exec` cannot be caught by the same function in the new program, since the address of the signal-catching function in the caller probably has no meaning in the new program file that is executed. [p325]

With a shell that doesn’t support job control, when we execute a process in the background:

```sh
cc main.c &
```

The shell automatically sets the disposition of the interrupt and quit signals in the background process to be ignored. This is done so that if we type the interrupt character, it doesn’t affect the background process. If this weren’t done and we typed the interrupt character, it would terminate not only the foreground process, but also all the background processes.

Many interactive programs that catch these two signals have code that looks like:

```c
void sig_int(int), sig_quit(int);

if (signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN) != SIG_IGN)
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int);
if (signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN) != SIG_IGN)
    signal(SIGQUIT, sig_quit);
```

<u>Following this approach, the process catches the signal only if the signal is not currently being ignored.</u>

The `signal` function has a limitation: we are not able to determine the current disposition of a signal without changing the disposition. The `sigaction` function (discussed later in this chapter) allows us to determine a signal’s disposition without changing it.

#### Process Creation

When a process calls `fork`, the child inherits the parent’s signal dispositions. Here, since the child starts off with a copy of the parent’s memory image, the address of a signal-catching function has meaning in the child.

### Unreliable Signals

In earlier versions of the UNIX System, signals were unreliable, which means that signals could get lost: a signal could occur and the process would never know about it. [p326]

One problem with these early versions was that the action for a signal was reset to its default each time the signal occurred. The code that was described usually looked like:

```c
    int sig_int(); /* my signal handling function */
    ...
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int); /* establish handler */
    ...

sig_int()
{
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int); /* reestablish handler for next time */
    ... /* process the signal ... */ .
}
```

The problem with this code fragment is that there is a window of time (after the signal has occurred, but before the call to `signal` in the signal handler) when the interrupt signal could occur another time. This second signal would cause the default action to occur, which terminates the process. This is one of those conditions that works correctly most of the time, causing us to think that it is correct, when it isn’t.

Another problem with these earlier systems was that the process was unable to turn a signal off when it didn’t want the signal to occur. All the process could do was ignore the signal. There are times when we would like to tell the system "prevent the following signals from interrupting me, but remember if they do occur". The following code catches a signal and sets a flag for the process that indicates that the signal occurred:

```c
int sig_int(); /* my signal handling function */
int sig_int_flag; /* set nonzero when signal occurs */

main()
{
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int); /* establish handler */
    ...
    while (sig_int_flag == 0)
        pause(); /* go to sleep, waiting for signal */
    ...
}

sig_int()
{
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int); /* reestablish handler for next time */
    sig_int_flag = 1; /* set flag for main loop to examine */
}
```

The process is calling the `pause` function to put it to sleep until a signal is caught. When the signal is caught, the signal handler just sets the flag `sig_int_flag` to a nonzero value. The process is automatically awakened by the kernel after the signal handler returns, notices that the flag is nonzero, and does whatever it needs to do. But there is a window of time when things can go wrong. If the signal occurs after the test of `sig_int_flag` but before the call to pause, the process could go to sleep forever (assuming that the signal is never generated again). This occurrence of the signal is lost.

### Interrupted System Calls

In earlier UNIX systems, if a process caught a signal while the process was blocked in a "slow" system call, the system call was interrupted. The system call returned an error and `errno` was set to `EINTR`. This was done under the assumption that since a signal occurred and the process caught it, there is a good chance that something has happened that should wake up the blocked system call.

#### Slow system calls

The system calls are divided into two categories: the "slow" system calls and all the others. The slow system calls are those that can block forever:

* Reads that can block the caller forever if data isn’t present with certain file types (pipes, terminal devices, and network devices)
* Writes that can block the caller forever if the data can’t be accepted immediately by these same file types
* Opens on certain file types that block the caller until some condition occurs (such as a terminal device open waiting until an attached modem answers the phone)
* The `pause` function (which by definition puts the calling process to sleep until a signal is caught) and the `wait` function
* Certain `ioctl` operations
* Some of the interprocess communication functions

The notable exception to these slow system calls is anything related to disk I/O. Although a read or a write of a disk file can block the caller temporarily (while the disk driver queues the request and then the request is executed), unless a hardware error occurs, the I/O operation always returns and unblocks the caller quickly.

Historically, POSIX.1 semantics gave implementations a choice of how to deal with `read`s and `write`s that have processed partial amounts of data, implementations derived from System V fail the system call, whereas BSD-derived implementations return partial success. With the 2001 version of the POSIX.1 standard, the BSD-style semantics are required. [p328]

The problem with interrupted system calls is that we now have to handle the error return explicitly. assuming a read operation and assuming that we want to restart the read even if it’s interrupted, the typical code sequence would be:

```c
again:
    if ((n = read(fd, buf, BUFFSIZE)) < 0) {
        if (errno == EINTR)
            goto again; /* just an interrupted system call */
        /* handle other errors */
    }
```

#### Automatic restarts of interrupted system calls

Automatic restarting of certain interrupted system calls were introducted since 4.2BSD to prevent applications from having to handle interrupted system calls. The system calls that were automatically restarted are:

* Functions that are interrupted by a signal only if they are operating on a slow device:
    * `ioctl`
    * `read`
    * `readv`
    * `write`
    * `writev`
* Functions that are always interrupted when a signal is caught.
    * `wait`
    * `waitpid`

Some applications didn’t want the operation restarted if it was interrupted; 4.3BSD allowed the process to disable this feature on a per-signal basis.

##### Difference between the `signal` and `sigaction` functions on restarts

POSIX.1 requires an implementation to restart system calls only when the `SA_RESTART` flag is in effect for the interrupting signal. This flag is used with the `sigaction` function to allow applications to request that interrupted system calls be restarted.

Historically, when using the `signal` function to establish a signal handler, implementations varied with respect to how interrupted system calls were handled. System V never restarted system calls by default. BSD, in contrast, restarted them if the calls were interrupted by signals. On FreeBSD 8.0, Linux 3.2.0, and Mac OS X 10.6.8, when signal handlers are installed with the `signal` function, interrupted system calls will be restarted. By using our own implementation of the `signal` function, we avoid having to deal with these differences. [p329]

One reason 4.2BSD introduced the automatic restart feature is that sometimes we don’t know that the input or output device is a slow device. [p329]

The figure below summarizes the signal functions and their semantics provided by the various implementations.

[![Figure 10.3 Features provided by various signal implementations](figure_10.3.png)](figure_10.3.png "Figure 10.3 Features provided by various signal implementations")

Later this chapter, we provide our own version of the `signal` function that automatically tries to restart interrupted system calls (other than for the `SIGALRM` signal), and `signal_intr`, that tries to never do the restart.

### Reentrant Functions

When a signal that is being caught is handled by a process, the normal sequence of instructions being executed by the process is temporarily interrupted by the signal handler. The process then continues executing, but the instructions in the signal handler are now executed. If the signal handler returns (instead of calling `exit` or `longjmp`), then the normal sequence of instructions that the process was executing when the signal was caught continues executing. This is similar to what happens when a hardware interrupt occurs.

However, in the signal handler, we can’t tell where the process was executing when the signal was caught:

* What if the process was in the middle of allocating additional memory on its heap using `malloc`, and we call `malloc` from the signal handler?
    * Havoc can result for the process, since `malloc` usually maintains a linked list of all its allocated areas, and it may have been in the middle of changing this list.
* What if the process was in the middle of a call to a function, such as `getpwnam` ([Section 6.2](ch6.md#password-file)), that stores its result in a static location, and we call the same function from the signal handler?
    * The information returned to the normal caller can get overwritten with the information returned to the signal handler.

The Single UNIX Specification specifies the functions that are guaranteed to be safe to call from within a signal handler. These functions are reentrant and are called **async-signal safe** by the SUS. Besides being reentrant, they block any signals during operation if delivery of a signal might cause inconsistencies.

The following table lists these async-signal safe functions, which are reentrant functions that may be called from a signal handler.

  |   |   |   |   |
- | - | - | - | - |
`abort` | `faccessat` | `linkat` | `select` | `socketpair`
`accept` | `fchmod` | `listen` | `sem_post` | `stat`
`access` | `fchmodat` | `lseek` | `send` | `symlink`
`aio_error` | `fchown` | `lstat` | `sendmsg` | `symlinkat`
`aio_return` | `fchownat` | `mkdir` | `sendto` | `tcdrain`
`aio_suspend` | `fcntl` | `mkdirat` | `setgid` | `tcflow`
`alarm` | `fdatasync` | `mkfifo` | `setpgid` | `tcflush`
`bind` | `fexecve` | `mkfifoat` | `setsid` | `tcgetattr`

`cfsetospeed` | `fsync` | `openat` | `sigaction` | `tcsetpgrp`
`chdir` | `ftruncate` | `pause` | `sigaddset` | `time`
`chmod` | `futimens` | `pipe` | `sigdelset` | `timer_getoverrun`
`chown` | `getegid` | `poll` | `sigemptyset` | `timer_gettime`
`clock_gettime` | `geteuid` | `posix_trace_event` | `sigfillset` | `timer_settime`
`close` | `getgid` | `pselect` | `sigismember` | `times`
`connect` | `getgroups` | `raise` | `signal` | `umask`
`creat` | `getpeername` | `read` | `sigpause` | `uname`
`dup` | `getpgrp` | `readlink` | `sigpending` | `unlink`
`dup2` | `getpid` | `readlinkat` | `sigprocmask` | `unlinkat`
`execl` | `getppid` | `recv` | `sigqueue` | `utime`
`execle` | `getsockname` | `recvfrom` | `sigset` | `utimensat`
`execv` | `getsockopt` | `recvmsg` | `sigsuspend` | `utimes`
`execve` | `getuid` | `rename` | `sleep` | `wait`
`_Exit` | `kill` | `renameat` | `sockatmark` | `waitpid`
`_exit` | `link` | `rmdir` | `socket` | `write`

Most of the functions that are not included in table above are missing because:

* They are known to use static data structures;
* They call `malloc` or `free`;
* They are part of the standard I/O library.

Note when using the functions in the table above:

* Most implementations of the standard I/O library use global data structures in a nonreentrant way.
* Be aware that even if we call a function listed in the table above from a signal handler, there is only one `errno` variable per thread (recall the discussion of errno and threads in [Section 1.7](ch1.md#error-handling)), and we might potentially modify its value.
    * Consider a signal handler that is invoked right after main has set `errno`. If the signal handler calls `read`, for example, this call can change the value of `errno`, wiping out the value that was just stored in `main`.

    Therefore, as a general rule, when calling the functions listed in the table above from a signal handler, we should save and restore `errno`. Be aware that a commonly caught signal is `SIGCHLD`, and its signal handler usually calls one of the wait functions. All the `wait` functions can change `errno`.

* `longjmp` ([Section 7.10](ch7.md#setjmp-and-longjmp-functions)) and `siglongjmp` ([Section 10.15](#sigsetjmp-and-siglongjmp-functions)) are missing
from the table because the signal may have occurred while the `main` routine was updating a data structure in a nonreentrant way. This data structure could be left half updated if we call `siglongjmp` instead of returning from the signal handler. If it is going to do such things as update global data structures, while catching signals that cause `sigsetjmp` to be executed, an application needs to block the signals while updating the data structures.

#### Example of calling `getpwnam` from a signal handler *

The code below shows a program that calls the nonreentrant function `getpwnam` from a signal handler that is called every second. We use the `alarm` function ([Section 10.10](alarm-and-pause-functions)) here to generate a `SIGALRM` signal every second.

<small>[signals/reenter.c](https://github.com/shichao-an/apue.3e/blob/master/signals/reenter.c)</small>

```c
#include "apue.h"
#include <pwd.h>

static void
my_alarm(int signo)
{
	struct passwd	*rootptr;

	printf("in signal handler\n");
	if ((rootptr = getpwnam("root")) == NULL)
			err_sys("getpwnam(root) error");
	alarm(1);
}

int
main(void)
{
	struct passwd	*ptr;

	signal(SIGALRM, my_alarm);
	alarm(1);
	for ( ; ; ) {
		if ((ptr = getpwnam("sar")) == NULL)
			err_sys("getpwnam error");
		if (strcmp(ptr->pw_name, "sar") != 0)
			printf("return value corrupted!, pw_name = %s\n",
					ptr->pw_name);
	}
}
```

When this program was run, the results were random. Usually, the program would be terminated by a `SIGSEGV` signal when the signal handler returned after several iterations. An examination of the `core` file showed that the main function had called `getpwnam`, but that when `getpwnam` called `free`, the signal handler interrupted it and called `getpwnam`, which in turn called `free`. The data structures maintained by `malloc` and `free` had been corrupted when the signal handler (indirectly) called `free` while the main function was also calling `free`. Occasionally, the program would run for several seconds before crashing with a `SIGSEGV` error. When the main function did run correctly after the signal had been caught, the return value was sometimes corrupted and sometimes fine.

### `SIGCLD` Semantics

Two signals that continually generate confusion are `SIGCLD` and `SIGCHLD`. The name `SIGCLD` (without the `H`) is from System V, and this signal has different semantics from the BSD signal, named `SIGCHLD`. The POSIX.1 signal is also named `SIGCHLD`.

The semantics of the BSD `SIGCHLD` signal are normal and its semantics are similar to all other signals. When the signal occurs, the status of a child has changed, and we need to call one of the `wait` functions to determine what has happened.

System V, however, has traditionally handled the `SIGCLD` signal differently from other signals:

1. If the process specifically sets its disposition to `SIG_IGN`, children of the calling process will not generate zombie processes. [p333]
    * 4.4BSD always generates zombies if `SIGCHLD` is ignored. If we want to avoid zombies, we have to `wait` for our children.
2. If we set the disposition of `SIGCLD` to be caught, the kernel immediately checks whether any child processes are ready to be `wait`ed for and, if so, calls the `SIGCLD` handler. [p333-335]
    * FreeBSD 8.0 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 don’t exhibit this problem, because BSD-based systems generally don’t support historical System V semantics for SIGCLD.
    * Linux 3.2.0 also doesn’t exhibit this problem, because it doesn’t call the `SIGCHLD` signal handler when a process arranges to catch `SIGCHLD` and child processes are ready to be waited for, even though `SIGCLD` and `SIGCHLD` are defined to be the same value.
    * Solaris avoids this problem by including extra code in the kernel.

Of the four platforms described in this text, only Linux 3.2.0 and Solaris 10 define `SIGCLD`. On these platforms, `SIGCLD` is equivalent to `SIGCHLD`.

### Reliable-Signal Terminology and Semantics

This section defines some terms used through the discussion of signals.

* A signal is *generated* for a process (or sent to a process) when the event that causes the signal occurs. When the signal is generated, the kernel usually sets a flag of some form in the process table. The event could be:
    * Hardware exception (e.g., divide by 0),
    * Software condition (e.g., an alarm timer expiring),
    * Terminal-generated signal,
    * A call to the `kill` function.
* A signal is *delivered* to a process when the action for a signal is taken.
* A signal is *pending* during the time between its generation and delivery.
* A process has the option of *blocking* the delivery of a signal. If a signal that is blocked is generated for a process, and if the action for that signal is either the default action or to catch the signal, then the signal remains pending for the process until the process either:
    * unblocks the signal, or
    * changes the action to ignore the signal.

    The system determines what to do with a blocked signal when the signal is delivered, not when it’s generated. This allows the process to change the action for the signal before it’s delivered. The `sigpending` function ([Section 10.13](#sigpending-function)) can be called by a process to determine which signals are blocked and pending.

POSIX.1 allows the system to deliver the signal either once or more than once in case a blocked signal is generated more than once before the process unblocks the signal. If the system delivers the signal more than once, we say that the signals are *queued*. Most UNIX systems, however, do not queue signals unless they support the real-time extensions to POSIX.1. Instead, the UNIX kernel simply delivers the signal once. [p336]

[Section 10.20](#sigqueue-function) discusses queueing signals further.

POSIX.1 does not specify the order in which the signals are delivered to the process. The Rationale for POSIX.1 does suggest, however, that signals related to the current state of the process be delivered before other signals. (`SIGSEGV` is one such signal.)

Each process has a **signal mask** that defines the set of signals currently blocked from delivery to that process. This mask has one bit for each possible signal. If the bit is on for a given signal, that signal is currently blocked. A process can examine and change its current signal mask by calling `sigprocmask` ([Section 10.12](#sigprocmask-function)). Since it is possible for the number of signals to exceed the number of bits in an integer, POSIX.1 defines a data type, called `sigset_t`, that holds a **signal set**. The signal mask is stored in one of these signal sets. The five functions that operate on signal sets are described in [Section 10.11](#signal-sets).

### `kill` and `raise` Functions

* The `kill` function sends a signal to a process or a group of processes.
* The `raise` function allows a process to send a signal to itself.
    * The `raise` function was originally defined by ISO C. POSIX.1 includes it to align itself with the ISO C standard, but POSIX.1 extends the specification of raise to deal with threads. Since ISO C does not deal with multiple processes, it could not define a function, such as `kill`, that requires a process ID argument.

```c
#include <signal.h>

int kill(pid_t pid, int signo);
int raise(int signo);

/* Both return: 0 if OK, −1 on error */
```

The call:

```c
raise(signo);

```

is equivalent to the call:

```c
kill(getpid(), signo);
```

There are four different conditions for the *pid* argument to kill:

* `pid` > 0. The signal is sent to the process whose process ID is `pid`.
* `pid` == 0 The signal is sent to all processes whose process group ID equals the process group ID of the sender and for which the sender has permission to send the signal.
* `pid` < 0. The signal is sent to all processes whose process group ID equals the absolute value of `pid` and for which the sender has permission to send the signal.
* `pid` == −1. The signal is sent to all processes on the system for which the sender has permission to send the signal.

Note that the term *all processes* in the four conditions above excludes an implementation-defined set of system processes, including kernel processes and `init` (pid 1).

A process needs permission to send a signal to another process:

* The superuser can send a signal to any process.
* For other users, the real or effective user ID of the sender has to equal the real or effective user ID of the receiver. If the implementation supports `_POSIX_SAVED_IDS`, the saved set-user-ID of the receiver is checked instead of its effective user ID.
* One special case for the permission testing also exists: if the signal being sent is `SIGCONT`,aprocess can send it to any other process in the same session.

Some other notes on the `kill` function:

* POSIX.1 defines signal number 0 as the null signal. If the *signo* argument is 0, then the normal error checking is performed by `kill`, but no signal is sent. This technique is often used to determine if a specific process still exists. If we send the process the null signal and it doesn’t exist, `kill` returns −1 and `errno` is set to `ESRCH`. Be aware, however, that UNIX systems recycle process IDs after some amount of time, so the existence of a process with a given process ID does not necessarily mean that it’s the process that you think it is.
* The test for process existence is not atomic. By the time that `kill` returns the answer to the caller, the process in question might have exited, so the answer is of limited value.
* If the call to `kill` causes the signal to be generated for the calling process and if the signal is not blocked, either *signo* or some other pending, unblocked signal is delivered to the process before `kill` returns. For additional conditions that occur with threads, see [Section 12.8](ch12.md#threads-and-signals).

### `alarm` and `pause` Functions

The `alarm` function sets a timer that will expire at a specified time in the future. When the timer expires, the `SIGALRM` signal is generated. If we ignore or don’t catch this signal, its default action is to terminate the process.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);

/* Returns: 0 or number of seconds until previously set alarm */
```

* The *seconds* value is the number of clock seconds in the future when the signal should be generated. When that time occurs, the signal is generated by the kernel, although additional time could elapse before the process gets control to handle the signal, because of processor scheduling delays.
* There is only one of these alarm clocks per process. If `alarm` is called with a previously registered alarm clock not yet expired, then:
    * The number of seconds left for previous alarm clock is returned as the value of this function.
    * The previous alarm clock is replaced by the new value.
* If a previously registered alarm clock for the process has not yet expired and if the seconds value is 0, the previous alarm clock is canceled. The number of seconds left for that previous alarm clock is still returned as the value of the function.

Although the default action for `SIGALRM` is to terminate the process, most processes that use an alarm clock catch this signal, which can perform whatever cleanup is required before terminating if the process wants to terminate. <u>If we intend to catch `SIGALRM`, we need to be careful to install its signal handler before calling `alarm`. If we call `alarm` first and are sent `SIGALRM` before we can install the signal handler, our process will terminate.</u>

The `pause` function suspends the calling process until a signal is caught.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int pause(void);

/* Returns: −1 with errno set to EINTR */
```

The only time `pause` returns is if a signal handler is executed and that handler returns. In that case, `pause` returns −1 with `errno` set to `EINTR`.

#### Example of using `alarm` and `pause`

Using `alarm` and `pause`, we can put a process to sleep for a specified amount of time. The following implementation of `sleep1` is incomplete and has problems:

#### Example of implementing `sleep` using `setjmp` and `longjmp`

<small>[signals/sleep1.c](https://github.com/shichao-an/apue.3e/blob/master/signals/sleep1.c)</small>

```c
#include	<signal.h>
#include	<unistd.h>

static void
sig_alrm(int signo)
{
	/* nothing to do, just return to wake up the pause */
}

unsigned int
sleep1(unsigned int seconds)
{
	if (signal(SIGALRM, sig_alrm) == SIG_ERR)
		return(seconds);
	alarm(seconds);		/* start the timer */
	pause();			/* next caught signal wakes us up */
	return(alarm(0));	/* turn off timer, return unslept time */
}
```

This simple implementation has three problems:

1. **If the caller already has an alarm set, that alarm is erased by the first call to `alarm`.** We can correct this by looking at `alarm`’s return value:
    * If the number of seconds until some previously set alarm is less than the argument, then we should wait only until the existing alarm expires.
    * If the previously set alarm will go off after ours, then before returning we should reset this alarm to occur at its designated time in the future.
2. **We have modified the disposition for `SIGALRM`.** If we’re writing a function for others to call, we should save the disposition when our function is called and restore it when we’re done. We can correct this by saving the return value from `signal` and resetting the disposition before our function returns.
3. **There is a race condition between the first call to `alarm` and the call to `pause`**.  On a busy system, it’s possible for the alarm to go off and the signal handler to be called before we call pause. If that happens, the caller is suspended forever in the call to `pause` (assuming that some other signal isn’t caught).

The following example corrects problem 3 as described above using `setjmp`. The problem 3 can also be corrected using `sigprocmask` and `sigsuspend`, as described in [Section 10.19](#sleep-nanosleep-and-clock_nanosleep-functions).

<small>[signals/sleep2.c](https://github.com/shichao-an/apue.3e/blob/master/signals/sleep2.c)</small>

```c
#include	<setjmp.h>
#include	<signal.h>
#include	<unistd.h>

static jmp_buf	env_alrm;

static void
sig_alrm(int signo)
{
	longjmp(env_alrm, 1);
}

unsigned int
sleep2(unsigned int seconds)
{
	if (signal(SIGALRM, sig_alrm) == SIG_ERR)
		return(seconds);
	if (setjmp(env_alrm) == 0) {
		alarm(seconds);		/* start the timer */
		pause();			/* next caught signal wakes us up */
	}
	return(alarm(0));		/* turn off timer, return unslept time */
}
```

The `sleep2` function avoids the race condition. Even if the `pause` is never executed, the `sleep2` function returns when the `SIGALRM` occurs.

<small>[signals/tsleep2.c](https://github.com/shichao-an/apue.3e/blob/master/signals/tsleep2.c)</small>

```c

#include "apue.h"

unsigned int	sleep2(unsigned int);
static void		sig_int(int);

int
main(void)
{
	unsigned int	unslept;

	if (signal(SIGINT, sig_int) == SIG_ERR)
		err_sys("signal(SIGINT) error");
	unslept = sleep2(5);
	printf("sleep2 returned: %u\n", unslept);
	exit(0);
}

static void
sig_int(int signo)
{
	int				i, j;
	volatile int	k;

	/*
	 * Tune these loops to run for more than 5 seconds
	 * on whatever system this test program is run.
	 */
	printf("\nsig_int starting\n");
	for (i = 0; i < 300000; i++)
		for (j = 0; j < 4000; j++)
			k += i * j;
	printf("sig_int finished\n");
}
```

Run this program and interrupt the sleep by typing the interrupt character:

```shell-session
$ ./a.out
ˆC                 # we type the interrupt character
sig_int starting
sleep2 returned: 0
```

The `longjmp` from the `sleep2` function aborted the other signal handler, `sig_int`, even though it wasn’t finished.





### Signal Sets







### Doubts and Solutions
#### Verbatim

[p324] on some macro constants in `<signal.h>`:

> These constants can be used in place of the "pointer to a function that takes an integer argument and returns nothing", the second argument to `signal`, and the return value from `signal`. The three values used for these constants need not be −1, 0, and 1. They must be three values that can never be the address of any declarable function. Most UNIX systems use the values shown.

Why is the macro in the form `SIG_ERR (void (*)())-1` and the like?

Solution:

They are integer that cast into an address which means the "pointer to a function that takes an integer argument and returns nothing". `void (*)()` tells the compiler to ignore type-checking for the parameters. See:
