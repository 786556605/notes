### **Chapter 15. Interprocess Communication**

This chapter discusses other techniques for processes to communicate with one another: interprocess communication (IPC).

The figure below summarizes the various forms of IPC that are supported by the four implementations discussed in this text.

[![Figure 15.1 Summary of UNIX System IPC](figure_15.1.png)](figure_15.1.png "Figure 15.1 Summary of UNIX System IPC")

* The "SUS" column allows an implementation to support full-duplex pipes, but requires only half-duplex pipes.
* "(full)" shows implementations that support half-duplex pipes by using full-duplex pipes.
* The bullet means that basic functionality is supported.
* "UDS" means that the feature of full-duplex pipes can be provided through UNIX domain sockets

[p533-534]

The first ten forms of IPC in the figure above are usually restricted to IPC between processes on the same host. The final two rows: sockets and STREAMS, are the only two forms that are generally supported for IPC between processes on different hosts.

This chapter dicusses classical IPC: pipes, FIFOs, message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.

### Pipes

Pipes are the oldest form of UNIX System IPC and are provided by all UNIX systems. Pipes have two limitations:

1. Historically, they have been half duplex (data flows in only one direction).  Some systems now provide full-duplex pipes, but for maximum portability, we should never assume that this is the case.
2. Pipes can be used only between processes that have a common ancestor. Normally, a pipe is created by a process, that process calls `fork`, and the pipe is used between the parent and the child.

FIFOs (Section 15.5) get around the second limitation, and that UNIX domain sockets (Section 17.2) get around both limitations.

Despite these limitations, half-duplex pipes are still the most commonly used form of IPC. Every time you type a sequence of commands in a pipeline for the shell to execute, the shell creates a separate process for each command and links the standard output of one process to the standard input of the next using a pipe.

A pipe is created by calling the `pipe` function.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int pipe(int fd[2]);

/* Returns: 0 if OK, −1 on error */
```

Two file descriptors are returned through the *fd* argument: *fd[0]* is open for reading, and *fd[1]* is open for writing. The output of *fd[1]* is the input for *fd[0]*.

POSIX.1 allows for implementations to support full-duplex pipes. For these implementations, *fd[0]* and *fd[1]* are open for both reading and writing.

Two ways to picture a half-duplex pipe are shown in the figure below. The left half of the figure shows the two ends of the pipe connected in a single process. The right half of the figure emphasizes that the data in the pipe flows through the kernel.

[![Figure 15.2 Two ways to view a half-duplex pipe](figure_15.2.png)](figure_15.2.png "Figure 15.2 Two ways to view a half-duplex pipe")

The `fstat` function returns a file type of FIFO for the file descriptor of either end of a pipe. We can test for a pipe with the `S_ISFIFO` macro.

POSIX.1 states that the `st_size` member of the stat structure is undefined for pipes. But when the `fstat` function is applied to the file descriptor for the read end of the pipe, many systems store in `st_size` the number of bytes available for reading in the pipe, which is nonportable.

A pipe in a single process is next to useless. Normally, the process that calls pipe then calls `fork`, creating an IPC channel from the parent to the child, or vice versa. The following figure shows this scenario:

[![Figure 15.3 Half-duplex pipe after a fork](figure_15.3.png)](figure_15.3.png "Figure 15.3 Half-duplex pipe after a fork")

What happens after the `fork` depends on which direction of data flow we want. For a pipe from the parent to the child, the parent closes the read end of the pipe (*fd[0]*), and the child closes the write end (*fd[1]*). The following figure shows the resulting arrangement of descriptors.

[![Figure 15.4 Pipe from parent to child](figure_15.4.png)](figure_15.4.png "Figure 15.4 Pipe from parent to child")

For a pipe from the child to the parent, the parent closes fd[1], and the child closes fd[0].

When one end of a pipe is closed, two rules apply:

1. If we `read` from a pipe whose write end has been closed, `read` returns 0 to
indicate an end of file after all the data has been read.
    * Technically, we should say that this end of file is not generated until there are no more writers for the pipe.
    * It’s possible to duplicate a pipe descriptor so that multiple processes have the pipe open for writing.
    * Normally, there is a single reader and a single writer for a pipe. (The FIFOs in the next section dicusses that there are multiple writers for a single FIFO.)
2. If we `write` to a pipe whose read end has been closed, the signal `SIGPIPE` is generated. If we either ignore the signal or catch it and return from the signal handler, `write` returns −1 with `errno` set to `EPIPE`.

When we’re writing to a pipe (or FIFO), the constant `PIPE_BUF` specifies the kernel’s pipe buffer size. A write of `PIPE_BUF` bytes or less will not be interleaved with the writes from other processes to the same pipe (or FIFO). But if multiple processes are writing to a pipe (or FIFO), and if we write more than `PIPE_BUF` bytes, the data might be interleaved with the data from the other writers. We can determine the value of `PIPE_BUF` by using `pathconf` or `fpathconf`.

### `popen` and `pclose` Functions

The standard I/O library has historically provided the `popen` and `pclose` functions. These two functions handle all the dirty work that we’ve been doing ourselves: creating a pipe, forking a child, closing the unused ends of the pipe, executing a shell to run the command, and waiting for the command to terminate.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *popen(const char *cmdstring, const char *type);

/* Returns: file pointer if OK, NULL on error */

int pclose(FILE *fp);

/* Returns: termination status of cmdstring, or −1 on error */
```

The function `popen` does a `fork` and `exec` to execute the *cmdstring* and returns a standard I/O file pointer. If *type* is "r", the file pointer is connected to the standard output of *cmdstring*, as shown in the figure below:

[![Figure 15.9 Result of fp = popen(cmdstring, "r")](figure_15.9.png)](figure_15.9.png "Figure 15.9 Result of fp = popen(cmdstring, r)")

If type is "w", the file pointer is connected to the standard input of *cmdstring*, as shown in the figure below:

[![Figure 15.10 Result of fp = popen(cmdstring, "w")](figure_15.10.png)](figure_15.10.png "Figure 15.10 Result of fp = popen(cmdstring, w)")

The `pclose` function closes the standard I/O stream, waits for the command to terminate, and returns the termination status of the shell. (The termination status is described in [Section 8.6](ch8.md#exit-status-vs-termination-status). The `system` function, described in [Section 8.13](ch8.md#system-function), also returns the termination status.) If the shell cannot be executed, the termination status returned by `pclose` is as if the shell had executed `exit(127)`.

The cmdstring is executed by the Bourne shell, as in:

```shell
sh -c cmdstring
```

This means that the shell expands any of its special characters in *cmdstring*. This allows us to say, for example,

```c
fp = popen("ls *.c", "r");
```

or

```c
fp = popen("cmd 2>&1", "r");
```

### Coprocesses

A UNIX system filter is a program that reads from standard input and writes to standard output. Filters are normally connected linearly in shell pipelines. A filter becomes a **coprocess** when the same program generates the filter’s input and reads the filter’s output.

The Korn shell provides coprocesses. The Bourne shell, the Bourne-again shell, and the C shell don’t provide a way to connect processes together as coprocesses. A coprocess normally runs in the background from a shell, and its standard input and standard output are connected to another program using a pipe.  Although the shell syntax required to initiate a coprocess and connect its input and output to other processes is quite contorted, coprocesses are also useful from a C program.

Whereas `popen` gives us a one-way pipe to the standard input or from the standard output of another process, with a coprocess we have two one-way pipes to the other process: one to its standard input and one from its standard output. We want to write to its standard input, let it operate on the data, and then read from its standard output.

Example

For example, the process creates two pipes: one is the standard input of the coprocess and the other is the standard output of the coprocess. The figure below shows this arrangement:

[![Figure 15.16 Driving a coprocess by writing its standard input and reading its standard output](figure_15.16.png)](figure_15.16.png "Figure 15.16 Driving a coprocess by writing its standard input and reading its standard output")

[p549-552]

### FIFOs

FIFOs are sometimes called named pipes. Unnamed pipes can be used only between related processes when a common ancestor has created the pipe. With FIFOs, however, unrelated processes can exchange data.

A FIFO is a type of file ([Chapter 4](ch4.md#file-types)). One of the encodings of the `st_mode` member of the stat structure indicates that a file is a FIFO. We can test for this with the `S_ISFIFO` macro. Creating a FIFO is similar to creating a file; the *pathname* for a FIFO exists in the file system.

```c
#include <sys/stat.h>

int mkfifo(const char *path, mode_t mode);
int mkfifoat(int fd, const char *path, mode_t mode);

/* Both return: 0 if OK, −1 on error */
```

The specification of the *mode* argument is the same as for the `open` function. The rules for the user and group ownership of the new FIFO are the same as we described in [Section 4.6](ch4.md#ownership-of-new-files-and-directories).  The `mkfifoat` function is similar to the mkfifo function, except that it can be used to create a FIFO in a location relative to the directory represented by by the *fd* file descriptor argument. Like the other *at functions, there are three cases:

1. If the *path* parameter specifies an absolute pathname, then the *fd* parameter is ignored and the `mkfifoat` function behaves like the `mkfifo` function.
2. If the *path* parameter specifies a relative pathname and the *fd* parameter is a valid file descriptor for an open directory, the pathname is evaluated relative to this directory.
3. If the *path* parameter specifies a relative pathname and the *fd* parameter has the special value `AT_FDCWD`, the pathname is evaluated starting in the current working directory, and `mkfifoat` behaves like `mkfifo`.

Once we have used `mkfifo` or `mkfifoat` to create a FIFO, we open it using `open`. The normal file I/O functions (e.g., `close`, `read`, `write`, `unlink`) all work with FIFOs.

Applications can create FIFOs with the `mknod` and `mknodat` functions. Because POSIX.1 originally didn’t include `mknod`, the `mkfifo` function was invented specifically for POSIX.1.  The `mknod` and `mknodat` functions are included in the XSI option in POSIX.1.  POSIX.1 also includes support for the `mkfifo(1)` command. All four platforms discussed in this text provide this command. As a result, we can create a FIFO using a shell command and then access it with the normal shell I/O redirection.

When we open a FIFO, the nonblocking flag (`O_NONBLOCK`) affects what happens:
* In the normal case (without `O_NONBLOCK`), an open for read-only blocks until some other process opens the FIFO for writing. Similarly, an open for writeonly blocks until some other process opens the FIFO for reading.
* If `O_NONBLOCK` is specified, an `open` for read-only returns immediately. But an open for write-only returns −1 with `errno` set to `ENXIO` if no process has the FIFO open for reading.

What does "interleaved" mean here?
