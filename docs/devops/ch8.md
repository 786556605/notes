### **Chapter 8. Security and Security Audits**

### What Is Security?

The case study in [Chapter 12](ch12.md) discusses an approach that advocates integrating the security team into the adoption process. Other DevOps activities that are candidates for the discussion of security are:

* **Security audits.** When a security audit is imminent, coordination between Dev and Ops becomes quite important.
* **Securing the deployment pipeline.** The deployment pipeline itself is an attractive target for malicious attackers.
* **Microservice architectures.** The adoption of a microservice architecture introduces new security challenges.
