### **Chapter 13. The Virtual Filesystem**

The **Virtual Filesystem** (VFS), sometimes called the **Virtual File Switch** is the subsystem of the kernel that implements the file and filesystem-related interfaces to user-space. All filesystems rely on the VFS not only to coexist but also to interoperate. This enables programs to use standard Unix system calls to read and write to different filesystems, even on different media.
