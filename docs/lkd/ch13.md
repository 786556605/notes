### **Chapter 13. The Virtual Filesystem**

The **Virtual Filesystem** (VFS), sometimes called the **Virtual File Switch** is the subsystem of the kernel that implements the file and filesystem-related interfaces to user-space. All filesystems rely on the VFS not only to coexist but also to interoperate. This enables programs to use standard Unix system calls to read and write to different filesystems, even on different media.

### Common Filesystem Interface

The VFS is the glue that enables system calls such as `open()`, `read()`, and `write()` to work regardless of the filesystem or underlying physical medium. The system calls work between these different filesystems and media; we can use standard system calls to copy or move files from one filesystem to another. Modern operating systems, such as Linux, abstract access to the filesystems via a virtual interface that such interoperation and generic access is possible. [p262]

New filesystems and new varieties of storage media can find their way into Linux, and programs need not be rewritten or even recompiled.
