### **Chapter 3. Process Management**

This chapter introduces the concept of the **process**. The process management is a crucial part of any operating system kernel, including Linux. 

### The Process

A process is a program (object code stored on some media) in the midst of execution.

Besides the executing program code (*text section* in Unix), processes also include a set of resources:

* Open files 
* Pending signals
* Internal kernel data
* Processor state
* Memory address space with one or more memory mappings
* **Thread(s) of execution**
* Data section containing global variables

#### Threads of execution

Threads of execution, often shortened to **threads**,  are the objects of activity within the process.

Each thread includes:

* Program counter
* Process stack
* Set of processor registers

The kernel schedules individual threads, not processes. <u>Linux does not differentiate between threads and processes. To Linux, a thread is just a special kind of process.</u>


#### Virtualized processor and virtual memory

On modern operating systems, processes provide two virtualizations: a **virtualized processor** and **virtual memory**.

* The virtual processor gives the process the illusion that it alone monopolizes the system, despite possibly sharing the processor among hundreds of other processes. See [Chapter 4. Process Scheduling](/lkd/ch4/).
* Virtual memory lets the process allocate and manage memory as if it alone owned all the memory in the system. See [Chapter 12. Memory Management](/lkd/ch12/)

<u>Threads share the virtual memory abstraction</u>, whereas each receives its own virtualized processor.


#### Life of a process

A process is an active program and related resources:

* Two or more processes can exist that are executing the *same* program.
* Two or more processes can exist that share various resources, such as open files or an address space.

#### fork, exec, exit and wait

In Linux, the `fork()` system call creates a new process by duplicating an existing one.

* The process that calls `fork()` is the parent, whereas the new process is the child.
* The parent resumes execution and the child starts execution at the same place: where the call to `fork()` returns.
* The `fork()` system call <u>returns from the kernel twice: once in the parent process and again in the newborn child.</u>

The `exec()` family of function calls creates a new address space and loads a new program into the newborn child immediately after a fork. In contemporary Linux kernels, <u>`fork()` is actually implemented via the `clone()` system call</u>, which is discussed in a following section.  

The `exit()` system call terminates the process and frees all its resources. A parent process can inquire about the status of a terminated child via the `wait4()` system call. A process can wait for the termination of a specific process. <u>When a process exits, it is placed into a special zombie state that represents terminated processes until the parent calls `wait()` or `waitpid()`.</u> The kernel implements the `wait4()` system call. Linux systems, via the C library, typically provide the `wait()`, `waitpid()`, `wait3()`, and `wait4()` functions.


### Process Descriptor and the Task Structure

Another name for a process is a **task**. The Linux kernel internally refers to processes as tasks. In this book, the terms are used interchangeably, though <u>"task" generally refers to a process from the kernelâ€™s point of view.</u>
