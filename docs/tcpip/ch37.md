#### Part II-7: TCP/IP Routing Protocols (Gateway Protocols)

Routing is not just one of the most important activities at the network layer, but also the function that defines layer 3 of the [OSI Reference Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). Routing is what enables small local networks to be linked together to form potentially huge internetworks that can span cities, countries, or even the entire globe. The job of routing is done by special devices called **routers**, which forward datagrams from network to network, allowing any device to send to any other device, even if the source has no idea where the destination is.

Routers decide how to forward a datagram based on its destination address, which is compared to information the router keeps in special routing tables. These tables contain entries for each of the networks the router knows about, telling the router which adjacent router the datagram should be sent to in order for it to reach its eventual destination.

Routing tables are critically important to the routing process. It is possible for these tables to be manually maintained by network administrators, but this is tedious and time-consuming and doesnâ€™t allow routers to deal with changes or problems in the internetwork. Instead, most modern routers are designed with functionality that lets them share route information with other routers, so they can keep their routing tables up-to-date automatically. This information exchange is accomplished through the use of [**routing protocols**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol).
